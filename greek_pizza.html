    <p style="font-size: 30px">Greek pizza was created by Greek immigrants who came to America and were introduced to Italian pizza. 
        Greek-style pizza, especially popular in the New England states, features a thick and chewy crust cooked in shallow, oiled pans, resulting in a nearly deep-fried bottom. 
        While this style has a crust that is puffier and chewier than thin crust pizzas, itâ€™s not quite as thick as a deep-dish or Sicilian crust.</p>
    <h2><b><p style="font-size: 40px;">Greek Pizza Traditional Toppings</p></b></h2>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">Greek pizza is usually heavier on the sauce than the cheese. The sauce typically has a tangy tomato paste with a strong oregano flavor. It is often only topped with cheese, which is usually a mix of mozzarella and cheddar or provolone. It may feature a variety of non-Greek or Greek toppings, such as feta cheese, black olives, and red onion.</p>

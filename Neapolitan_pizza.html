    <p style="font-size: 30px">Neapolitan is the original pizza. This delicious pie dates all the way back to 18th century in Naples, Italy. 
        During this time, the poorer citizens of this seaside city frequently purchased food that was cheap and could be eaten quickly.
        Luckily for them, Neapolitan pizza was affordable and readily available through numerous street vendors.</p>
    <h2><b><p style="font-size: 40px;">Neapolitan pizza Traditional Topings</p></b></h2>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">The typical Neapolitan pizza toppings are fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil leaves, oregano, and olive oil. Since Neapolitan pizza is thin, it isn't designed to handle the weight of too many toppings. In fact, Neapolitan pizza is so thin that it's typically eaten with a fork and knife.</p>
